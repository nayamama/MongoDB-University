1. Consider the following set of operations executing in the mongo shell:

	use m040
	db.a.insert({_id: 1})
	s1 = db.getMongo().startSession()
	s2 = db.getMongo().startSession()
	s1.startTransaction()
	s2.startTransaction()
	s1.getDatabase("m040").a.find()
	s2.getDatabase("m040").a.find()
	s1.getDatabase("m040").a.update({_id:1}, {$set: {value: "s1"}})
	s1.getDatabase("m040").a.find() // line 10
	s2.getDatabase("m040").a.find() // line 11
	s2.getDatabase("m040").a.update({_id:1}, {$set: {value: "s2"}})
	s1.getDatabase("m040").a.find()
	s2.getDatabase("m040").a.find()
	s1.abortTransaction()
	s2.abortTransaction()
	s1.getDatabase("m040").a.find()
	s2.getDatabase("m040").a.find() // line 18

a.The output of line 11 is
	{
	  _id: 1,
	  value: "s2"
	}
b. WriteConflict occurs on line 12 (Y)
c. The output of line 10 is
	{
	  _id: 1,
	  value: "s1"
	} (Y)
d. The output of line 18 is
	{
	  _id: 1,
	  value: "s1"
	}
	
2. Which of the following are new capabilities added in MongoDB 4.0 for sharded cluster administration ?

a. Aborting an operation running on many shards (Y)
b. Sharding on a hashed shard key
c. Identifying slow queries in the mongos logs (Y)
d. Adding tags to shards

3. Consider this document:

	{
	  _id: 1,
	  time: "10/01/2018"
	}
	If we execute the following aggregation:

	db.collection.aggregate([
	  {
		$addFields: {
		  time: {
			$dateToParts: {
			  date: {
				$dateFromString: {
				  dateString: "$time",
				  format: "%d/%m/%Y"
				}
			  }
			}
		  }
		}
	  },
	  {
		$project:{
		  time: {
			$dateFromParts: {
			  "month": {$add:[-13, "$time.month"]},
			  "year": "$time.year"
			}
		  }
		}
	  }
	])

a. The aggregation command fails due to an out-of-bound date.
b. The year on the date is 2016. (Y)
c. The day in the date field is 1st of December. (Y)
d. The _id is not present in the output document.
e. The aggregation command fails with an "Unknown format field error".

4. Which of the following statements is/are true regarding features recently added to Atlas?

a. You must use the live migrator tool to migrate out of the free tier.
b. In Azure, Atlas supports backups as local snapshots in the region in which the cluster is located. (Y)
c. Using the Atlas BI connector frees you from maintaining the process locally. (Y)
d. Atlas allows to keep data in given regions to comply with data governance, like GDPR. (Y)
e. Only AWS supports sharded clusters.

5. Which of the following statements is/are true regarding upgrades to MongoDB 4.0 or downgrades from 4.0?

a. You can downgrade a cluster without downtime (Y)
b. The flag previousVersionCompatibility controls the ability to use the new 4.0 features
c. You can upgrade a cluster without downtime (Y)
d. You can upgrade directly from MongoDB 3.4 to MongoDB 4.0
