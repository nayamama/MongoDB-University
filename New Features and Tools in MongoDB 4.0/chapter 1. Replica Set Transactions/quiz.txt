1. Which of the following statements are true about MongoDB Replica Set Transactions?

a. Transactions work across Replica Set clusters. (Y)
b. Prior to transactions, MongoDB was not able to guarantee ACID operations over single document operations.
c. Transactions only work with standalone mongod instances.
d. With transactions in MongoDB, schema design is no longer relevant.

2. Which of the following are true in the case of multi-document transaction operations?

a. WiredTiger can proactively evict snapshots and abort transactions if cache pressure thresholds are reached. (Y)
b. If a transaction takes more than 60 seconds to complete, it will abort. (Y)
c. In cases where there is a significant amount of write operations in one single transaction (more than 1000 changed documents), the transaction should be broken into smaller sets of operations. (Y)
d. You can only read up to 1000 documents in a transaction.
	(There are no practical limits to the number of documents that can be read in a transaction. There's only the limit of up to 1000 documents modified in a single transaction. For those cases, we should split the transaction across several transactions.)
	
3. Which of the following statements are correct?

b. All writes not in a transaction context will be applied before the transaction write lock are released.
c. All writes not in a transaction context will fail while a transaction is taking place.

	(All write operations wait until the transaction aborts or commits)
	
4. What can cause TransientTransactionError to occur?

a. Network failures (Y)
b. WriteConflict errors (Y)
c. Stack overflow error
d. Out-of-memory error
