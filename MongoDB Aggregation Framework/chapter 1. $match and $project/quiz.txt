1. Which of the following is/are true of the $match stage?

a. It uses the familiar MongoDB query language. (Y)
b. $match can only filter documents on one field.
c. It should come very early in an aggregation pipeline. (Y)
d. $match can use both query operators and aggregation expressions.

notes: If we use $match in early stage, we can reduce the number of documents to process, and use the indexes within the pipeline execution.

2. Which of the following statements are true of the $project stage?

a. Once we specify a field to retain or perform some computation in a $project stage, we must specify all fields we wish to retain. The only exception to this is the _id field. (Y)
b. Beyond simply removing and retaining fields, $project lets us add new fields. (Y)
c. $project can only be used once within an Aggregation pipeline.
d. $project cannot be used to assign new values to existing fields.
